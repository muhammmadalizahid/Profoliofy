Member Equity=25%*3=75%
Dividend in terms: 1) Summer = 5% 2) Completion of MVP = 10% 3) Further development = 5% 4) After Success 5%

Idea Equity = 8%
Advisor Equity (Sir Awais) = 17% (Will be adjusted from idea equity if he asks for more) 

Investor Equity: Will be adjusted on % basis from each person's owned equity at that time excluding advisor equity (would include it if Sir Awais agrees lol which is highly unlikely)

Thinking to Propose 15% to Sir Awais, if he agrees, rest will go to investor equity if needed else charity.
